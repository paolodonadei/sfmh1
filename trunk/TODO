! feature pruning, debug it to see if it actually works
! show bad matches in red
! write down features per image so that the tracking matrix makes sense, otherwise the indices point to nothing
! write down the header for the track text file
!check memory leaks with valgrind
! i get negative errors in the matches file
! in teh matches file some points have zero error but they seem to be outliers
!match two images should return the number of inliers found and if such is small (like zero) the two images should be decoupled
____________________________________________________________________________________
- prune out the pairwise matches using the fundamental Matrix
* can we find trifocal tensor rather than f matrix?
* build a dependency graph where every image is related to its closest neighbour and process them in a pipeline as such instead of processing all things at the same timer_t
of course inintially everything will be processed together but later we will change this and show that it can improve performance

-do some testing on your results
-the next thing to do is to add in the feature track class to the right file and also to create a pairwise image relation that contains the geometry and then calculate that geometry
-from now on use this text file
