! cant suppress sift exec output_iterator_tag
! feature pruning, debug it to see if it actually works
! how come if we find the error with respect to both inliers and outliers its so small? check to see if we do get a big error for outliers
! calculate error wrt inliers
! show bad matches in red
! write down features per image so that the tracking matrix makes sense, otherwise the indices point to nothing
! write down the header for the track text file
!check memory leaks with valgrind
____________________________________________________________________________________
- prune out the pairwise matches using the fundamental Matrix
* can we find trifocal tensor rather than f matrix?
* build a dependency graph where every image is related to its closest neighbour and process them in a pipeline as such instead of processing all things at the same timer_t
of course inintially everything will be processed together but later we will change this and show that it can improve performance

-do some testing on your results
-the next thing to do is to add in the feature track class to the right file and also to create a pairwise image relation that contains the geometry and then calculate that geometry
-from now on use this text file
