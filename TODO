! read up on matrix stuff on opencv
! the epipolar errors dont work, fix it

- prune out the pairwise matches using the fundamental Matrix
* can we find trifocal tensor rather than f matrix?
* build a dependency graph where every image is related to its closest neighbour and process them in a pipeline as such instead of processing all things at the same timer_t
of course inintially everything will be processed together but later we will change this and show that it can improve performance

-do some testing on your results
-the next thing to do is to add in the feature track class to the right file and also to create a pairwise image relation that contains the geometry and then calculate that geometry
-from now on use this text file
